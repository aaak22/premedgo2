                  2.1 Types of Data / Privacy Policy Scope “Personal Data” means any information about an individual from which that person can be identified. It does not include data where the identity has been removed (anonymous data). We may collect, use, store and transfer different kinds of Personal Data about you which we have grouped together below. Not all of the following types of data will necessarily be collected from you but this is the full scope of data that we collect and when we collect it from you: Profile/Identity Data: This is data relating to your first name, last name, gender, date of birth. Contact Data: This is data relating to your phone number, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers. Marketing and Communications Data: This is your preferences in receiving marketing information and other information from us. Billing Data: This is information relating to your debit and credit card information such as the name attached to your payment details and your billing address. Financial Data: These are your banking details e.g. your account number and sort code. Transactional Data: This is information of details and records of all payments you have made for our services or products.

Customer Support Data: This includes feedback and survey responses. Usage Data: information about how you use our website, products and services.

                <li class="my-4">
                  2.2 The Legal Basis for Collecting That Data There are a number of justifiable reasons under the GDPR that allow collection and processing of Personal Data. The main avenues we rely on are:<br /> <b>“Consent”:</b> Certain situations allow us to collect your Personal Data, such as when you tick a box that confirms you are happy to receive email newsletters from us, or ‘opt in’ to a service.<br /> <b>“Contractual Obligations”:</b> We may require certain information from you in order to fulfil our contractual obligations and provide you with the promised service.<br /> <b>“Legal Compliance”:</b> We’re required by law to collect and process certain types of data, such as fraudulent activity or other illegal actions.<br /> <b>“Legitimate Interest”:</b> We might need to collect certain information from you to be able to meet our legitimate interests - this covers aspects that can be reasonably expected as part of running our business, that will not have a material impact on your rights, freedom or interests. Examples could be your address, so that we know where to deliver something to, or your name, so that we have a record of who to contact moving forwards. For the special categories of data that we collect, the enhanced legal justification we rely on is:<br /> (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of such Personal Data for one or more specified purposes (“Explicit Consent”) <br />(b) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3 (“Medical”);`

As a matter of common sense, you are more likely to get a reply if your request or question is polite, reasonable and there is no relatively obvious other way to deal with or answer your concern or question (e.g. FAQs, other areas of our website etc.). Our staff are not authorised to contract on behalf of PREMEDGO HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES Ltd, waive rights or make representations (whether contractual or otherwise). If anything contained in an email from a PREMEDGO HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES Ltd address contradicts anything in this policy, our terms or any official public announcement on our website, or is inconsistent with or amounts to a waiver of any PREMEDGO HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES Ltd rights, the email content will be read down to grant precedence to the latter. The only exception to this is genuine correspondence expressed to be from the PREMEDGO HEALTHCARE TECHNOLOGIES Ltd legal department.</p>
